# NgChatApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

## Chat App
Public discussion forumv0.1

### Featues
1. Public discussion using chat
2. Authentication with firebase
3. Auth Guard implemented for better security
4. Fun little app with huge potential.

### Upcoming Features
1. Login with basic social system(Facebook, Gmail etc)
2. Better system to show online user

# Run

Clone this repo and install packages with yarn install.

### Important
Right now as the app is in dev mode, I have not shared firebase authentication and API code here.
Just create a project on firebase and add "Add Firebase to your app" by putting the code in the environment file.
